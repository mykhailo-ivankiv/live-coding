      This is a simple calendar app built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It is not a feature complete calendar app, but it
      does the basics things you would expect from a calendar app.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      Probably the main use case for this component is to copy the code and use it as a starting point for your own
      implementation.

    <Calendar />
