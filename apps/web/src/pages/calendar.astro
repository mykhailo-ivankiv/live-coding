		This is a simple calendar app built with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It is not a feature complete calendar app, but it
		does the basics things you would expect from a calendar app.
	</p>
	<p class="my-4">
		Probably the main use case for this component is to copy the code and use it as a starting point for your own
		implementation.
